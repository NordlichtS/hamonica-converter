Your Reality (Doki Doki Literature Club) FULL SONG
Verse one
6     6 6    6 -5 5 -5    6 6 -5  5 -4 5 -5    4 3
Every day, I imagine  a future where I can be with you
6   -6    6 6 -6   -6 -5 5      5 -4 -4 4 3 -4     5 4
In my hand is  a pen that will write  a poem of me and you
6       6 6       -5 5 4 -4   5 -5 6
The ink flows down into  a dark puddle
-6       6 5     -4 3 -3     4 3 4 -4 4
Just move your hand - write the way into his heart!
6    6 6       -5 5 4  -4 5 -5 6
But in this, world  of infinite choices
-6        6 5 -4      3 4 4 3    -4 5 4
What will it take just to find that special day?
-6        6 5 -4      3 4 4 3    -4 5 4
What will it take just to find that special day?
Verse two (Same as Verse one)
Have I found everybody a fun assignment to do today?
When you're here, everything that we do is fun for them anyway
When I can't even read my own feelings
What good are words when a smile says it all?
And if this world won't write me an ending
What will it take just for me to have it all?
Verse three
6         6 6 6 -5     5 5 -5 6   -5 5 -4 5    -4 4  3
Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me ?
6  -6  6 6   -5 5    -5 6 6 -6     6 -5 5 -4 5     4
Is  it love  if I take  you, or is it love if   I set you free?
6       6 6      -5 5 4 -4  5 -5 6
The ink flows down into   a dark puddle
-6      6 5 -4      3 -3 4 3 4 -4 4
How can I write love into     reality?
6 6  6  -5 5       4 -4 5   -5 6
If I can't hear the sound of your heartbeat
-6        6 5 -4     3 -3 4 3  4 -4 4
What do you call love in your   reality?
4      3 4   3 4 -4 4    4 -4 5    -4 5 -4  5 6
And in your   reality, if   I don't know how to love you..
3      3 4    4
I'll leave you be
