# hamonica-converter
a simple python tool to convert numbered harptaps into intuitive sheet (for blues harmonica layout, but you can change that)

basically the very first useful python script i made back in 2019

make sure to configure PATH to where you run it (for example, desktop) (ok it's now relative path, put them all in the same folder)
